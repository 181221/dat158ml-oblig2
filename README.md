[NYC Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data)

### Thoughts

For this Machine-learning assignment I chose Taxi Trip Duration [Kaggle Playground Competition] dataset. Because I think estimating a duration for a given taxi might be fun and realistic. I also wanted to find out what impact the different parameters has on each other. For example if a taxi uses longer time with more passengers.
This is my second ml project. This project gave me a better understanding of how machinelearning works and how it is used in practice. It also refreshed my memory on statistics which is a long time since I had.

### Getting Started

The main jypter file is called **taxi-trip.ipynb**. Here is all the code for the project.
